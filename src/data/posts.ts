*A compiled collage of some of my favorite meals in Australia*

## Description 

For each of my diary entries, I decided to make a collage of photos that relate to the specific topic or post I’m writing about. In this collage, I pulled together pictures of different foods and dishes I ate across the program, with a particular emphasis on multicultural and non-Australian cuisines. Highlights include Khao Soi (a Northern Thai dish), Bún Bò Nam Bộ (a Vietnamese beef noodle salad), and a traditional burrata mortadella sandwich.

## Personal Description

If you should know anything about me, it’s that I love food; one of my biggest passions is cooking, and I love sharing meals with friends and family. Much like how some people travel to visit museums or major landmarks, I travel for food. I enjoy learning about new places through the lens of what foods are eaten, respected, and culturally cherished.

During my first few weeks in Sydney, I’ve been fascinated by the sheer range of cuisines, food staples, and beloved national dishes around the city. Similar to the United States, which doesn’t have a single, isolated culinary identity, Australia seems to define its food culture as an amalgamation of multicultural dishes rooted in its complex history: meat pies from England, Chiko Rolls inspired by Chinese spring rolls, Vegemite created as a local answer to Marmite, and Spaghetti Bolognese adapted from traditional southern Italian pastas. In Sydney, I was able to try Marmite for the first time, Chiko Rolls, and a frankly ridiculous amount of Spaghetti Bolognese.

Like food itself, which naturally reflects deep multicultural connections, the Australian emphasis on healthy, “pure” ingredients shows up in many of the dishes that have been adapted here. For example, the popular hamburger chain Grill’d emphasizes local, “no frills” ingredients, heavily branding itself around “100% natural” food and claiming to serve some of the healthiest burgers in Australia. If anything, this seems reflective of Australia’s “bush” origins and extensive ranching and cattle industry. Australia’s identity is deeply grounded in its agricultural and pastoralist backgrounds, and it feels likely that this focus on natural ingredients and a more holistic approach to food stems from that.


## Course Connection

In our AS course, we’ve discussed how colonization, immigration, and the construction of a collective national identity are central themes in Australian society and history. British colonization and imperial expansion in the 18th century brought strong cultural influences, including foods, dishes, and crops that had not previously existed on the continent, creating the first major wave of culinary (and cultural) introduction. Over the next two centuries, many additional waves of immigration—from Pacific Islanders, Southeast and South Asians, and numerous other communities—reshaped the country. Although these immigrant groups often faced discrimination, their foods gradually became beloved, incorporated, and celebrated. Food becomes one visible way to imagine and sustain multiculturalism, which is a critical cornerstone of contemporary Australia and a major theme of our course.`

![Collage of Surf Clubs and Beachs I've visited](images/life_saving_clubs.jpg)

## Background

Picture collage of some of the beaches we’ve visited, including shots of bright yellow surf lifesavers on patrol and some crowded beaches we went to (Bondi, Gold Coast, etc). I’ve also included a lot of photos that focus on the expansiveness of the beaches in Australia, because I think that’s important to why surf lifesaving clubs are needed (i.e designated swimming spots and rip currents). 

## Personal Description:

In my view, one of the coolest parts of this program has been the ocean: spending time by the water, swimming, and using our (few) rest days to live right next to the sea. Something I’ve noticed about Australia that the United States definitely does not have is the system of surf lifesaving clubs—these large buildings that look like a cross between a 70s dance club and a neon-yellow hospital, always perched right next to the beach with almost nothing around them. At first, I had no idea what these surf clubs were; for the first month, my best guess was that they were some kind of oceanside restaurant or bar.

It turns out these lifesaving clubs are exactly what they sound like: volunteer-based lifeguard and coastal safety hubs that keep swimmers, surfers, and beachgoers safe. Surf Life Saving Australia operates hundreds of affiliated clubs and patrols, with well over 180,000 members nationwide, and these clubs are considered an institutional part of Australia’s surf culture, existing to protect and celebrate the country’s extensive beaches. After visiting Bondi Beach in Sydney a few times, I wandered into a small exhibit about surf lifesaving clubs and their historical role in shaping Australian beach culture. The movement formally took off in 1907 at Bondi Beach as beaches became more popular and drownings increased, largely because many new beachgoers couldn’t swim.

In addition to providing surf and jetski-based ocean rescue, the clubs also run critical swim and surf safety programs for young kids, known as “Nippers,” to help them navigate the ocean safely and confidently. In contrast to the United States, which doesn’t really have a unified or cohesive national beach culture, Australia seems to have both a strong beach identity and a volunteer-based system built specifically for life saving and beach safety.

## Course Connection

At first glance, surf lifesaving clubs might not seem closely connected to our Australian Studies course, but they actually reflect many of the same societal themes. Over the decades, these clubs have mirrored broader shifts in Australian society, including the move toward multiculturalism and pluralism that we’ve discussed in class. While surf lifesaving was initially male-dominated and relatively exclusive, the movement has gradually embraced wider participation, including outreach to recent migrants, efforts to recognise and incorporate Aboriginal heritage and water knowledge, and a broader push to promote inclusion and safety for all beachgoers."`

## Description 

For each of my diary entries, I decided to make a collage of photos that relate to the specific topic or post I’m writing about. In this collage, I pulled together pictures of different foods and dishes I ate across the program, with a particular emphasis on multicultural and non-Australian cuisines. Highlights include Khao Soi (a Northern Thai dish), Bún Bò Nam Bộ (a Vietnamese beef noodle salad), and a traditional burrata mortadella sandwich.

## Personal Description

I remember what happened when I looked up “Australia’s work-life balance” for the first time: I almost fell out of my chair. The statistics are genuinely mind-boggling: Australia ranks around 8th in the world for work-life balance, with an official cap on full-time weekly working hours at 38 hours, and actual workweeks are usually much shorter. In practice, that means that no matter the time of day, there are always people outside, whether it be walking, talking, surfing, grabbing coffee, or just sitting in the sun. If there’s a country that feels like it “works to live” rather than “lives to work,” it’s definitely Australia.

Coming from my experience in the United States, where a strong culture of overwork is pretty normalized, this contrast was genuinely shocking. Back home, it isn’t unusual to hear about people pushing 50+ hour workweeks, especially in certain white-collar and blue-collar jobs, and then proudly wearing their work-induced exhaustion as a kind of badge of honor. In Australia, by contrast, there seems to be a quiet, almost taken-for-granted assumption that work should fit around life, not the other way around. Even small details underscore this: the way cafés stay busy on weekday mornings or even the number of people out running at Bondi after work (or even just hanging out on the beach during the workday). 

On a more personal level, experiencing (and living in) a completely different social culture has really changed how I value my own time, and how I choose to prioritize things. Before coming to Australia, it was easy to imagine sliding into a U.S.-style career path where long hours were just an inevitable trade-off for a good job. Seeing an alternative in Australia, where people can still work hard but also prioritize their social life, has been amazing, and honestly made me think about moving here. I think this whole experience has really challenged my “American” outlook on constant busyness and productivity, and nudged me to consider a version of my life that is more social yet still very work-focused.

## Description 

For each of my diary entries, I decided to make a collage of photos that relate to the specific topic or post I’m writing about.

Highlights include Khao Soi (a Northern Thai dish), Bún Bò Nam Bộ (a Vietnamese beef noodle salad), and a traditional burrata mortadella sandwich.

## Personal Description

Outside of this program, one of my main fields of interest is transportation and energy economics. So when I looked at the schedule and saw that we had eight different ferry trips planned, I was really excited. Compared to Australia, the United States has pretty minimal ferry infrastructure; most of our coastline is continuous, without major island chains off big cities, and we obviously don’t have anything like the Great Barrier Reef. The US mainly uses ferries for tourist destinations and fun day trips, but ferries in Australia are instead critical for commuters, students, and researchers; for example, the Heron Island ferry is essential for the research station, and the Minjerribah ferry is vital for high school students and everyday commuters alike.

To me, the heavy reliance on ferries signals a mild skepticism toward building massive infrastructure projects like bridges and causeways in sensitive coastal areas. If the Queensland government really wanted a massive bridge linking Brisbane’s mainland to Minjerribah, it could probably find a way to justify it, especially with the steady stream of tourists heading over each year on the current services. K’gari comes to mind as a great example of this. Part of the reward of exploring the island is that it remains relatively uninhabited and protected, and the reliance on ferries and limited access helps keep it that way.

On a personal level, these ferry rides have made me think a bit more about how transport shapes the way I value the different places we visit on this trip. There’s something about having to catch a specific boat, check the tide or weather, and watch the mainland slowly recede that makes the destination feel less disposable or “one-off”. I think the specific friction of the journey, and the fact that you can’t just hop in a car and drive over, creates a natural speed bump against overdevelopment and massive crowds. Strangely, I think I’ve come to really enjoy the slight disruption and hassle in our different transit days; It makes me appreciate each place we visit a little more, and the journey isn’t half too bad either. 

## Course Connection

I think this ferry topic, although narrow, connects to many of the themes we discussed in our environmental protection lecture. The introduction of environmental protection initiatives undoubtedly slows the rate of development, and additional government focus on protecting important ecosystems like marginal reefs (such as Minjerribah) clearly prevents the large-scale development of these places. Separately, I also think ferries can both advance reconciliation and, at times, complicate Aboriginal representation. For example, the ferry to Minjerribah brings large numbers of tourists to the island; some choose to engage in cultural activities like Welcome to Country or Aboriginal eco-tours. On the other hand, easier access also brings tourists who ignore cultural protocols, wander into restricted areas, or treat the Country as just another backdrop for their Instagram story or something. It’s interesting to draw parallels between ongoing development in Australia and reconciliation efforts; increasing tourism and transit opportunities bring real benefits, but they also create new challenges that Australia has to navigate carefully. `
